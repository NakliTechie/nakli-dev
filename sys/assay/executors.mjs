// Assay live role executors — run each campaign role as an AGENT and turn what it
// emits into a validated ledger block. This is what replaces the demo scripts: the
// driver (runmode.mjs) calls these; each one runs the role's agent (injected as
// `runRole`, so the harness is testable without a live model), captures the block the
// role emits via its `emit` tool, stamps + validates it, and hands it back.
//
// The WALL is enforced here at the information boundary, backed by the role grant sets:
// each role is handed only a role-scoped VIEW of the ledger — the Builder never
// receives findings or instrument cases (only directives), the Lead receives finding
// SUMMARIES (clusters/weights) but never raw cases. A role that cannot see the
// instrument cannot leak them, independent of the Grant check on any file access.

import { validateBlock } from './ledger.mjs';

// Condensed role manifests (Anvil amendment §1.1–1.3). The load-bearing constraints,
// as standing instructions handed to each role's agent.
